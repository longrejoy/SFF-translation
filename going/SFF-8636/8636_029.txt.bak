Foreword  
 
The development work on this specification was done by the SNIA SFF TWG, an 
industry group. Since its formation as the SFF Committee in August 1990, the 
membership has included a mix of companies which are leaders across the industry.  
 
When 2 1/2" diameter disk drives were introduced, there was no commonality on 
external dimensions e.g. physical size, mounting locations, connector type, 
connector location, between vendors. The SFF Committee provided a forum for system 
integrators and vendors to define the form factor of disk drives. 
 
During their definition, other activities were suggested because participants in 
SFF faced more challenges than the form factors. In November 1992, the charter was 
expanded to address any issues of general interest and concern to the storage 
industry. The SFF Committee became a forum for resolving industry issues that are 
either not addressed by the standards process or need an immediate solution.  
 
In July 2016, the SFF Committee transitioned to SNIA (Storage Networking Industry 
Association), as a TA (Technology Affiliate) TWG (Technical Work Group). 
  
Industry consensus is not a requirement to publish a specification because it is 
recognized that in an emerging product area, there is room for more than one 
approach. By making the documentation on competing proposals available, an 
integrator can examine the alternatives available and select the product that is 
felt to be most suitable.  
 
SFF meets during the T10 (see www.t10.org) and T11 (see www.t11.org) weeks, and 
SSWGs (Specific Subject Working Groups) are held at the convenience of the 
participants. Material presented to SFF becomes public domain, and there are no 
restrictions on the open mailing of the presented material by Members.  
 
Many of the specifications developed by SFF have either been incorporated into 
standards or adopted as standards by ANSI, EIA, JEDEC and SAE.

1   Scope 
This specification defines a common memory map and protocol that can be used to 
manage both 4-channel pluggable transceiver modules and 4-channel managed external 
cable interface implementations. Physical layer and mechanical details of the 
interface are outside the scope of this document. Memory map details and 
communication protocol used to transfer the information are described within this 
document. This approach facilitates a common memory map and management interface 
for applications with different mechanical, physical layer and otherwise different 
implementations. For example, SFF-8449 defines a 4-channel solution which documents 
the management interface physical layer, references SFF-8636 to ensure 
compatibility with the common memory map and protocol. 
 
This specification does not apply to the CFP MSA family of modules, which use the 
MDIO interface and a different memory map.

3   Definitions 
3.1   Fixed versus Free 
3.1.1  Fixed 
The terminology "fixed" is used to describe the gender of the mating side of the 
connector that accepts its mate upon mating. This gender is frequently, but not 
always, associated with the common terminology "receptacle". Other terms commonly 
used are "female" and "socket connector". The term "fixed" is adopted from EIA 
standard terminology as the gender that most commonly exists on the fixed end of a 
connection, for example, on the board or bulkhead side. 

3.1.2  Free 
The terminology "free" is used to describe the gender of the mating side of the 
connector that penetrates its mate upon mating. This gender is frequently, but not 
always, associated with the common terminology "plug". Other terms commonly used 
are "male" and "pin connector". The term "free" is adopted from EIA standard 
terminology as the gender that most commonly exists on the free end of a 
connection, for example, on the cable side. 

3.2   Passive Cable 
In this specification, a passive cable only requires power to operate the 
management interface circuitry. 

3.3   Active Cable 
In this specification, an active cable requires power for circuitry that is 
integral to any of the TX/RX high speed serial channels supported by the cable. In 
addition, the active cable requires power to operate the management interface. 

3.4   Pluggable Transceiver Module 
In this specification, a pluggable transceiver module requires power for the 
management interface and for the circuitry integral to the TX/RX high speed serial 
channels supported by the module. The module also has a media dependent interface 
(MDI), such as a duplex single mode fiber or a parallel multimode fiber connector          . 
The high speed electrical interface of the module may contain equalizers and 
retimers (CDRs) which are managed by registers defined in this management interface 
specification.

4   General Description  
The common management interface provides a method for the fixed side to determine 
the characteristics and status of the free side. In some implementations, the 
interface also provides a mechanism to control the operation of the free side 
circuitry. For the case where the free side is a cable, the fixed side can 
determine if the cable is passive, active copper, or active optical. For the case 
where the free side is a transceiver module, the fixed side can determine if the 
module is single mode, multimode or copper and which transmission standards are 
supported. Parameters such as supplier, part number, propagation delay and loss 
(for passive cables) can also be determined.

5   2-wire Bus Interface 
5.1   Signal Interface 
The 2-wire serial interface shall consist of a master and slave. The fixed side 
shall be the master and the free side shall be the slave. Control and data are 
transferred serially. The master shall initiate all data transfers. Data can be 
transferred from the master to the slave and from the slave to the master. The 2-
wire interface shall consist of clock (SCL) and data (SDA) signals. 
 
The master utilizes SCL to clock data and control information on the 2         -wire bus. 
The master and slave shall latch the state of SDA on the positive transitioning 
edge of SCL.  
 
The SDA signal is bi-directional. During data transfer, the SDA signal shall 
transition when SCL is low. A transition on the SDA signal while SCL is high shall 
indicate a stop or start condition. 

5.2   2-wire Bus Protocol 
5.2.1  Operational States and State Transition 
5.2.1.1    Start 
A high-to-low transition of SDA with SCL high is a START condition. All          2-wire bus 
operations shall begin with a START condition. 

5.2.1.2    Stop 
A low-to-high transition of SDA with SCL high is a STOP condition. All 2-wire bus 
operations shall end with a STOP condition 

5.2.1.3    Acknowledge 
After sending each 8-bit word, the side driving the 2-wire bus releases the SDA 
line for one bit time, during which the monitoring side of the         2-wire bus is 
allowed to pull SDA low (zero) to acknowledge (ACK) that it has received each word. 
Write data operations shall be acknowledged by the slave for all bytes. Read data 
operations shall be acknowledged by the master for all but the final byte read, for 
which the master shall respond with a non-acknowledge (NACK) by permitting SDA to 
remain high and followed by a STOP. 

5.2.1.4    Clock Stretching 
To extend the transfer the slave asserts clock low. This can be used by the slave 
to delay completion of the operation. 

5.2.2  Reset (Management Interface Only) 
5.2.2.1    Power On Reset 
The interface shall enter a reset state upon loss of power. After power is 
returned, the interface shall transition from the reset state within a time period 
that is beyond the scope of this document. 

5.2.2.2    Protocol Reset 
Synchronization issues may cause the master and slave state machines to disagree on 
the specific bit location currently being transferred, the type of operation or 
even if an operation is in progress. The 2-wire interface protocol has no 
explicitly defined reset mechanism. The following procedure may force completion of 
the current operation and cause the slave to release SDA. 
 
    a) The master shall provide up to nine SCL clock cycle (drive low, then high) to 
       the slave 
    b) The master shall monitor SDA while SCL is high on each cycle. 
    c) If the slave releases SDA, it will be high and the master shall initiate a 
       START operation 
Management Interface for Cabled Environments                               Page 21 Published                                                       SFF-8636 Rev 2.9 
 
    d) If SDA remains low after a full nine clock cycles the protocol reset has 
       failed 
 

5.2.2.3    Reset Signal 
 
Some implementations may include a reset pin. If provided, upon assertion of the 
reset pin the free side shall transition to the reset state. The delay for the 
state transition is beyond the scope of this document.  

5.2.3  Format 
5.2.3.1    Control 
After the start condition, the first 8-bit word of a 2-wire bus operation shall 
consist of '1010000' followed by a read/write control bit. 
 
 
          1          0         1         0          0         0         0        R/W 
         MSB                                                                     LSB 
 
The least significant bit indicates if the operation is a data read or write. A 
read operation is performed if this bit is high and a write operation is executed 
if this bit is set low. Upon completion of the control word transmission the slave 
shall assert the SDA signal low to acknowledge delivery (ACK) of the 
control/address word. 

5.2.3.2    Address and Data 
Following the read/write control bit, addresses and data words are transmitted in 
8-bit words. Data is transferred with the most significant bit (MSB) first. 
 

5.3   Read/Write Operations 
5.3.1  Slave Memory Address Counter (Read and Write Operations) 
All 2-wire slaves maintain an internal data word address counter containing the 
last address accessed during the latest read or write operation, incremented by 
one. The address counter is incremented whenever a data word is received or sent by 
the slave. This address remains valid between operations as long as power to the 
slave is maintained. Upon loss of power to or reset of the free side device, the 
slave address counter contents may be indeterminate. The address roll-over during 
read and writes operations is from the last byte of the 128-byte memory page to the 
first byte of the same page. 

5.3.2  Write Operations (BYTE Write) 
A write operation requires an 8-bit data word address following the device address 
write word (10100000) and acknowledgement. Upon receipt of this address, the slave 
shall again respond with a zero (ACK) to acknowledge and then clock in the first 8-
bit data word. Following the receipt of the 8-bit data word, the slave shall output 
a zero (ACK) and the master must terminate the write sequence with a STOP condition 
for the write cycle to begin. If a START condition is sent in place of a STOP 
condition (i.e. a repeated START per the 2-wire interface specification) the write 
is aborted and the data received during that operation is discarded. Upon receipt 
of the proper STOP condition, the slave enters an internally timed write cycle, 
tWR, to internal memory. The slave disables its management interface input during 
this write cycle and shall not respond or acknowledge subsequent commands until the 
internal memory write is complete.  
 
Note that 2-wire interface 'Combined Format' using repeated START conditions is not 
supported on write commands.

5.3.3  Write Operations (Sequential Write) 
The 2-wire slave shall support up to a 4 sequential byte write without repeatedly 
sending slave address and memory address information. A sequential write is 
initiated the same way as a single byte write, but the host master does not send a 
stop condition after the first word is clocked in. Instead, after the slave 
acknowledges receipt of the first data word, the master can transmit up to three 
more data words. The slave shall send an acknowledge after each data word received. 
The master must terminate the sequential write sequence with a STOP condition or 
the write operation shall be aborted and data discarded. Note that 2-wire interface 
'combined format' using repeated START conditions is not supported on write 
commands.

is complete. This involves sending a START condition followed by the device address 
word. Only if the internal write cycle is complete shall the slave respond with an 
acknowledge to subsequent commands, indicating read or write operations can 
continue. 

5.3.5  Read Operations (Current Address Read) 
A current address read operation requires only the slave address read word 
(10100001) be sent. Once acknowledged by the slave, the current address data word 
is serially clocked out. The transfer is terminated when the master responds with a 
NACK and a STOP instead of an acknowledge.

5.3.6  Read Operations (Random Read) 
A random read operation requires a dummy write operation to load in the target byte 
address. This is accomplished by the following sequence: The target 8-bit data word 
address is sent following the device address write word (10100000) and acknowledged 
by the slave. The master then generates another START condition (aborting the dummy 
write without incrementing the counter) and a current address read by sending a 
device read address (10100001). The slave acknowledges the device address and 
serially clocks out the requested data word. The transfer is terminated when the 
master responds with a NACK and a STOP instead of an acknowledge.

5.3.7  Read Operations (Sequential Read) 
Sequential reads are initiated by either a current address read or a random address 
read. To specify a sequential read, the master responds with an acknowledge 
(instead of a STOP) after each data word. As long as the slave receives an 
acknowledge, it shall serially clock out sequential data words. The transfer is 
terminated when the master responds with a NACK and a STOP instead of an 
acknowledge.

6   Memory Map 
6.1   Overview 
The memory map is utilized for status, ID, monitoring and control functions.  
 
The map is arranged into a single lower page address space of 128 bytes and 
multiple upper address pages. This structure permits timely access to addresses in 
the lower page such as interrupt flags and monitors. Less time critical entries 
such as serial ID information and threshold settings are available with the page 
select function. Data used for interrupt handling is located in         Lower Page 00h to 
enable single block read operations for time critical data. 
 
Upper Page 01h and Upper Page 02h are optional. Upper Page 01h allows 
implementation of application select table while Upper Page 02h provides a user 
read/write space. Implementation of these two pages is optional. Lower and Upper 
Page 00h are always implemented. Page 03h is required if Page 00h Byte 2 bit 2 is 
low. 
 
Upper pages 20h-21h contain support for additional monitored parameters for modules 
that have PAM4 modulation and/or have optical transmission at 2 wavelengths on a 
DWDM grid. Page 20h provides the alarms, warnings, masks, parameter values and 
configuration. Page 21h provides the alarm and warning thresholds. Pages 20h and 
21h are required if Page 00 Byte 195 bit 0 is high. 
 
Pages 22-7Fh are reserved for future use. Writing the value of a non-supported page 
shall not be accepted by the transceiver. The Page Select byte shall revert to 0 
and read/write operations shall be to Upper Page 00h. Pages 04-1Fh and 80-FFh are 
for vendor specific functions.

Note: Unless specifically stated otherwise, all informative ID fields must contain 
accurate data. Using a value of 0 to indicate a field is unspecified (as is common 
in the SFP definition) is not permitted. Reserved memory locations are to be filled 
with logic zeros in all bit locations for reserved bytes, and in reserved bit 
locations for partially specified byte locations. 
 

6.1.1  Required Versus Optional Functionality 
The memory map tables contained within this section include columns for passive 
cables (PC), active cables (AC), active optical cables (AO) and separable modules 
(SM). Depending on the free side device type, some common memory map parameters are 
optional. In each column, one of three options is specified: required (R), optional 
(O) or conditional upon another parameter which is optional (C).  Entries with a 
dash (-) indicate that whether the byte or bit is required is not relevant.

6.2   Lower Page 00h 
The 128 bytes of Lower Page 00h are used to access a variety of measurement, 
diagnostic and control functions. In addition, a mechanism to select upper memory 
map pages is provided. This portion of the address space is always directly 
addressable and thus is chosen for monitoring and control functions that may need 
to be repeatedly accessed.

The Data_Not_Ready bit shall be asserted high during free-side device reset, power 
up reset and prior to a valid suite of monitor readings. Once all monitor readings 
are valid, the bit is set low until the device is powered down or reset. Upon 
completion of power up reset, the free-side device shall assert the IntL output 
signal and bit (if supported) low while de-asserting the Data_Not_Ready bit low. 
The IntL bit will remain asserted until a read is performed of the Data_Not_Ready 
bit (Byte 2).

6.2.3  Interrupt Flags 
Bytes 3-21 consist of interrupt flags for LOS, TX Fault, warnings and alarms. The 
non-asserted state shall be 0b. If an interrupt flag condition is true, the free 
side shall assert the corresponding flag bit to 1b. The flag bit shall remain set 
until the fixed-side performs a read operation of the bit or the free side is 
reset. Flag bits cleared while underlying interrupt condition remains true may be 
immediately set again by the free side device. During this process the IntL output 
signal may be re-asserted if the associated mask bit is not set. These flags may be 
masked.

6.2.4  Free Side Device Monitors 
Real time monitoring for the free side device includes temperature, supply voltage, 
and monitoring for each transmit and receive channel.  
 
The fixed side shall use single 2-byte reads to retrieve all 16-bit data to 
guarantee data coherency. The free side device shall prevent the host from 
acquiring partially updated multi-byte data during a 2-byte read. Clock stretching 
provides one mechanism to delay the delivery of data until all bytes of one field 
have been updated. The data format may facilitate greater resolution and range than 
required. Reference of the specific product specification of the free side device 
or interoperability standard is necessary to determine the measurement accuracy. 
 
Measurements are calibrated over vendor specified operating temperature and voltage 
and should be interpreted as defined below. Alarm and warning threshold values 
should be interpreted in the same manner as real time 16-bit data.

Internally measured free side device temperatures are represented as a 16-bit 
signed twos complement value in increments of 1/256 degrees Celsius, yielding a 
total range of -128C to +128C that is considered valid between -40C and +125C. 
Temperature accuracy is Vendor Specific but must be better than +/-3C over 
specified operating temperature and voltage. Placement of the temperature sensor is 
vendor specific.  
 
Internally measured free side device supply voltages are represented as a 16         -bit 
unsigned integer with the voltage defined as the full 16-bit value (0 to 65535) 
with LSB equal to 100 uV, yielding a total measurement range of 0 to +6.55 V         . 
Practical considerations to be defined by free side device manufacturer will tend 
to limit the actual bounds of the supply voltage measurement. Accuracy is Vendor 
Specific but must be better than +/-3% of the manufacturer's nominal value over 
specified operating temperature and voltage. 
 

6.2.5  Channel Monitors 
Real time channel monitoring for each transmit and receive channel includes optical 
input power and TX bias current.  
 
Measurements are calibrated over vendor specified operating temperature and voltage 
and should be interpreted as defined below. Alarm and warning threshold values 
should be interpreted in the same manner as real time 16-bit data.

Measured TX bias current is represented in mA as a 16-bit unsigned integer with the 
current defined as the full 16-bit value (0 to 65535) with LSB equal to 2 uA, 
yielding a total measurement range of 0 to 131 mA. Accuracy is Vendor Specific but 
must be better than +/-10% of the manufacturer's nominal value over specified 
operating temperature and voltage. 
 
Measured RX received optical power is represented in mW as either an average 
received power or OMA depending upon how Page 00h Byte 220 bit 3 is set. The 
parameter is encoded as a 16-bit unsigned integer with the power defined as the 
full 16-bit value (0 to 65535) with LSB equal to 0.1 uW, yielding a total 
measurement range of 0 to 6.5535 mW (~-40 to +8.2 dBm). Absolute accuracy is 
dependent upon the exact optical wavelength. For the vendor specified wavelength, 
accuracy shall be better than +/-3 dB over specified temperature and voltage. This 
accuracy shall be maintained for input power levels up to the lesser of maximum 
transmitted or maximum received optical power per the appropriate stan         dard. It 
shall be maintained down to the minimum transmitted power minus cable plant loss 
(insertion loss or passive loss) per the appropriate standard. Absolute accuracy 
beyond this minimum required received input optical power range is Vendor Specific. 
 
Measured TX optical power is the average power represented in mW. The parameter is 
encoded as a 16-bit unsigned integer with the power defined as the full          16-bit 
value (0 to 65535) with LSB equal to 0.1 uW, yielding a total measurement range of 
0 to 6.5535 mW (~-40 to +8.2 dBm). For the vendor specified wavelength, accuracy 
shall be better than +/-3 dB over specified temperature and voltage.

For transceivers with CDR capability, setting the CDR to ON engages the internal 
retiming function. Setting the CDR to OFF enables an internal bypassing          mode, which 
directs traffic around the internal CDR. The two most common reasons to turn a CDR 
off (i.e. internally bypass it) are to run at bit rates not supported by a 
particular CDR or to save the thermal power in applications where CDR jitter 
mitigation is not required. Jitter specifications of the high speed interfaces are 
outside the scope of this specification. 
 
Management Interface for Cabled Environments                               Page 41 Published                                                       SFF-8636 Rev 2.9 
 
QSFP+ and QSFP28 modules have the LPMode input signal (see SFF-8679) that can be 
used by the host system to force the module into Low Power Mode.  Low Power Mode 
for those modules is defined as a maximum power consumption of 1.5W.  If the LPMo          de 
input signal is pulled low by the host system, the module is then capable of 
entering High Power Mode.  The maximum power consumption in High Power Mode depends 
on the module Power Class as advertised in the Extended Identifier (see 6.3.2), 
Page 00h, byte 129, bits 1-0 and 7-6.  
 
The operation of the LPMode input signal can be overridden by the host writing a 
‘1’ to byte 93, bit 0.  In that case, the function of the LPMode input signal is 
replaced by byte 93, bit 1. 
 
SFF-8436 has 4 power classes from 1.5 to 3.5 W.  Only bits 7-6 are used to define 
those power classes.  At revision 1.9 of this specification, 3 new higher power 
classes, 4.0 W, 4.5 W and 5.0 W were added. These power classes, designated power 
classes 5, 6 and 7, are designated using bits 1-0 of the Extended Identifier byte, 
page 00h byte 129.  In order to protect legacy host systems designed to support 
only the original 4 power classes, the High Power Class Enable control was defined 
at byte 93, bit 2.  Modules in power classes 5, 6 or 7 are required to limit power 
consumption to no more than a power class 4 module if the High Power Class Enable 
control is not set.  They are not required to be functional in this situation. 
 
A truth table for the power controls in byte 93 bits 0, 1 and 2, is shown in Table 
6-10.  
 
Power class limits and controls for microQSFP modules are different from the 
description here.  Refer to the MSA specification for details.

6.2.7  Rate Select 
Rate Select is an optional control used to limit the receiver bandwidt         h for 
compatibility with multiple bit rates. In addition, rate selection allows the 
transmitter to be fine-tuned for specific bit rate transmissions. 
 
The free side device shall implement one of the three options: 
 
a)     Provide no support for rate selection 
b)     Rate selection using extended rate select 
c)     Rate selection with application select tables 


Management Interface for Cabled Environments                               Page 43 Published                                                       SFF-8636 Rev 2.9 
 
6.2.7.1    No Rate Selection Support 
When no rate selection is supported, (Page 00h Byte 221 bits 2 and 3) have a value 
of 0 and Options (Page 00h Byte 195 bit 5) has a value of 0. Lack of implementation 
does not indicate lack of simultaneous compliance with multiple standard rates. See 
6.3.4 for the description of how compliance with particular standards should be 
determined. 

6.2.7.2    Extended Rate Selection 
When Page 00h Byte 195 bit 5 is 1 and Rate Select declaration bits (Page 00h Byte 
221 bits 2 and 3) have the values of 0 and 1 respectively and at least one of the 
bits in the Extended Rate Compliance byte (Page 00h Byte 141) has a value of one, 
the free side device supports extended rate select. For extended rate selection, 
two bits are assigned to each receiver in Byte 87 (Rxn_Rate_Select) and two bits 
for each transmitter in Byte 88 (Txn_Rate_Select) to specify up to four bit rates. 
See Table 6-11 for the functionality when Byte 141 bits 0-1 are set. All other 
values of the Extended Rate Compliance byte are reserved.

6.2.7.3    Rate Selection Using Application Select Tables 
When the Rate Select declaration bits (Page 00h Byte 221 bits 2-3) have the values 
of 1 and 0 respectively, the Application Select method defined in Page 01h is used 
(see 6.4, SFF-8079 and SFF-8089). The fixed side reads the entire application 
select table on Page 01h to determine the capabilities of the free side. The fixed 
side controls each channel separately by writing a Control Mode and Table Select 
(TS) byte to Bytes 89-92 and Bytes 94-97.  
 
        TABLE 6-12  APPLICATION SELECT (PAGE 00H BYTES 89-92 AND BYTES 94-97) 
                   7       6       5      4       3       2      1       0 
                 Control Mode                  Table Select TS 
 
 
Control Mode defines the application control mode. Table Select selects the free 
side device behavior from the Application Select Table (page 01h)  among 63 
possibilities (000000 to 111110). Note that (111111) is invalid.

         Note: Default values for control mode is 00 and is volatile memory. 
 

6.2.8  Free Side Device Indicators and Channel Masks 
The fixed side may control which flags result in a hardware interrupt by setting 
high individual bits from a set of masking bits in Page 00h Bytes 100-104 for free 
side device flags, and Page 03h Bytes 242-251 for channel flags. See Table 6-14 and 
Table 6-37. A 1 value in a masking bit prevents the assertion of the hardware 
interrupt pin, if one exists, by the corresponding latched flag bit. Masking bits 
are volatile and startup with all unmasked (masking bits 0). 
 
The mask bits may be used to prevent continued interruption from on-going 
conditions, which would otherwise continually reassert the hardware interrupt pin. 
A mask bit is allocated for each flag bit.

6.2.9  Free Side Device Properties 
The unsigned 16-bit value in Bytes 108-109 indicates the propagation delay of the 
non-separable free side device. Byte 108 bit 7 is the most significant bit and Byte 
109 bit 0 is the least significant. Each unit of the combined value corresponds to 
10 ns with fractional values rounded up to the next unit. 
 
Byte 110 bits 7-4 specify the free-side device power consumption levels below 1.5 
W. A value of 0000 shall indicate that a power consumption limit below 1.5 W is not 
available. A value of 0001 shall indicates the free-side device shall consume no 
more than 1 W, 0010 indicates no more than 0.75 W and 0011 indicates no more than 
0.5 W. 
 
A value of 1 in Byte 110 bit 3 shall indicate that both ends of the free-side 
device comply with the SFF-8636 specification. A value of 0 shall be utilized for 
all other cases including use of other management interfaces specifica         tions and 
separable applications where the free-side device ends and media can be physically 
separated from each other. Byte 110 bits 2-0 indicate that the free-side device can

operate properly from less than nominal 3.3 V on the Vcc pins. A value of 000 
indicates the feature is disabled. The free-side device shall operate properly from 
nominal 2.5 V with a value of 001 and nominal 1.8 V with a value of 010. 
 
The use of Bytes 111-112 is not defined in this specification.  
 
Byte 113 bits 3-0 specify which channels of the free side device at the near end 
are implemented. A value of 0 indicates that the channel is implemented and a value 
of 1 indicates that the channel is not implemented. 
 
Byte 113 bits 6-4 are used to indicate what type of device(s) are implemented at 
the far end(s) of a cable or module. A separable free side device or a device that 
does not specify the far end implementation is coded 000.

6.2.10  Password Entry and Change 
Bytes 119-126 are reserved for an optional password entry function. The Password 
entry bytes are write only and will be retained until power down, reset, or 
rewritten by fixed side. This function may be used to control read/write access to 
Vendor Specific Page 02h. Additionally, free side device vendors may use this 
function to implement write protection of Serial ID and other read only 
information. Passwords may be supplied to and used by fixed side system 
manufacturers to limit write access in the User EEPROM Page 02h. 
 
Password access shall not be required to access free side device data in the lower 
memory Page 00h or in Upper Page 00h, 02h and 03h. Note that multiple manufacturer 
passwords may be defined to allow selective access to read or write to various 
sections of memory as allowed above. 
 
Fixed side manufacturer and free side device manufacturer passwords shall be 
distinguished by the high order bit (bit 7, Byte 123). All fixed side manufacturer 
passwords shall fall in the range of 00000000h to 7FFFFFFFh, and all free side 
device manufacturer passwords in the range of 80000000h to FFFFFFFFh. Fixed side 
system manufacturer passwords shall be initially set to 00001011h in new free side 
devices. 
 
Fixed side system manufacturer passwords may be changed by writing a new password 
in Bytes 119-122 when the correct current fixed side manufacture password has been 
entered in 123-126, with the high order bit being ignored and forced to a value of 
0 in the new password. The password entry field shall be set to 00000000h on power 
up and reset. 

6.2.11  Page Select 
Byte 127 is used to select the upper page. A value of 00h indicates upper memory 
Page 00h is mapped to Bytes 128-255 and a value of 01h indicates that upper Page 
01h if available is mapped to Bytes 128-255. Similarly, values of 02h, 03h, 20h and 
21h indicate that the upper page identified is mapped to Bytes 128-255. If the host 
attempts to write a page select value which is not supported in a particular 
module, the Page Select byte will revert to 00h.

6.3.1  Identifier (00h 128) 
The Identifier Values at Byte 128 specify the physical device described by the 
serial information. This value shall be included in the serial data. These values 
are maintained in the Transceiver Management section of SFF-8024. 
 

6.3.2  Extended Identifier (00h 129) 
The extended identifier provides additional information about the free side device. 
For example, the identifier indicates if the free side device contains a CDR 
function and identifies the power consumption class it belongs to. 
 
New high power classes have been added to enable an emerging generation of 
capability requiring more than 3.5W of dissipation. However, legacy systems have 
generally been designed to a maximum of 3.5W. To ensure legacy systems are not 
harmed by power classes 5, 6 or 7 a lockout feature is added in         Byte 93 bit 2 to 
enable them. A legacy system will not know about Byte 129 bits 1-0 or about Byte 93 
bit 2. A new system will know about both and can configure power class 5 through 7 
support accordingly. The power class identifiers specify maximum power dissipation 
over operating conditions and lifetime with all supported settings set to worst 
case values.

in the serial data. These values are maintained in the Transceiver Management 
section of SFF-8024.

6.3.5  Encoding (00h 139) 
The Encoding Values at Page 00h Byte 139 indicate the serial encoding mechanism for 
the high-speed serial interface. The value shall be contained in the serial data. 
These values are maintained in the Transceiver Management section of SFF         -8024. 

6.3.6  Nominal Bit Rate (00h 140) 
The nominal bit rate per channel (BR, nominal) is specified in units of 100 
Megabits per second in Byte 140 and in units of 250 Megabits per second in Byte 
222. The bit rate includes those bits necessary to encode and delimit the signal as 
well as those bits carrying data information. A value of 0 indicates the bit rate           
is not specified and must be determined from the Module technology. A value of FFh 
in Byte 140 means the bit rate exceeds 25.4Gb/s and Byte 222 must be used to 
determine nominal bit rate. The actual information transfer rate will depend on the 
encoding of the data, as defined by the encoding value (Byte 139). 

6.3.7  Extended Rate Select Compliance (00h 141) 
The Extended Rate Select Compliance field is used to allow a single free side 
device the flexibility to comply with single or multiple Extended Rate          Select 
definitions. A definition is indicated by presence of a '1' in the specified bit. 
If exclusive, non-overlapping definitions are used, Page 00h Byte 141 will allow 
compliance to 8 distinct multi-rate definitions.

In addition to EEPROM data from original GBIC definition, this value specifies the 
Management Interface for Cabled Environments                               Page 54 Published                                                       SFF-8636 Rev 2.9 
 
link length that is supported by a separable module free side device while 
operating in compliance with the applicable standards using single mode fiber. 
Supported link length is as specified in INF-8074. The value is in units of 
kilometers. A value of zero means that the free side device does not support single 
mode fiber or that the length information must be determined from the free side 
device technology. For all cable assemblies, including active optical cables the 
value shall be zero. 

6.3.9  Length (OM3) (00h 143) 
This value specifies the link length that is supported by a separable module free 
side device while operating in compliance with the applicable standards using 
2000 MHz*km (850 nm) extended bandwidth 50-micron multi-mode fiber. The value is in 
units of 2 meters. A value of zero means that the free side device does not support 
OM3 fiber or that the length information must be determined from the free side 
device technology. For all cable assemblies, including active optical cables the 
value shall be zero. 
 

6.3.10  Length (OM2) (00h 144) 
This value specifies the link length that is supported by a separable module free 
side device while operating in compliance with the applicable standards using 500 
MHz*km (850 nm and 1310 nm) 50-micron multi-mode fiber. The value is in units of 1 
meter. A value of zero means that the free side device does not support OM2 fiber 
or that the length information must be determined from the free side device 
technology. For all cable assemblies, including active optical cables the value 
shall be zero. 

6.3.11  Length (OM1) or Copper Cable Attenuation (00h 145) 
This value specifies the link length that is supported by a separable module free 
side device while operating in compliance with the applicable standards using 
200 MHz*km (850 nm) and 500 MHz*km (1310 nm) 62.5-micron multi-mode fiber. The 
value is in units of 1 meter. A value of zero means that the free side device does 
not support OM1 fiber or that the length information must be determined from the 
free side device technology.  
 
For copper cable assemblies, where page 00h byte 147 bits 7-4 are 1010b, 1011b, 
1101b or 1111b, this register is used to record the cable attenuation (or apparent 
attenuation from the near end of the cable for active cables) at 25.78 GHz in units 
of 1 dB.  An indication of 0 dB attenuation refers to the case where the 
attenuation is not known or is unavailable.  For active optical cables or copper 
cables not listed in this paragraph the value shall be zero. 
 

6.3.12  Length: Cable Assembly or Optical Fiber (OM4) (00h 146) 
If a separable module (as indicated by a value other than 23h in Byte 130) free 
side device transmitter technology is 850nm VCSEL (indicated by         Byte 147 bits 7-4) 
then this value specifies the link length supported while operating in compliance 
with the applicable standards using 4700 MHz*km (850nm) extended bandwidth 50-
micron multi-mode fiber (OM4). The value is in units of 2 meters.  
 
Otherwise, this value specifies the link length of a Cable assembly (copper or AOC) 
in units of 1 meter. Link length is as specified in the INF-8074. Link lengths less 
than 1 meter shall indicate 1 meter.  
 
A value of zero means the free side device is not a cable assembly or the length 
information must be determined from the separable free side device technology. A 
value of 255 means a separable module VCSEL free side device supports a link length 
greater than 508 meters or the cable assembly has a link length greater than 254 
meters.

6.3.16  Vendor Organizationally Unique Identifier Field (00h 165-167) 
The vendor organizationally unique identifier field (vendor OUI) is a 3-byte field 
that contains the IEEE Company Identifier for the vendor. A value of all zero in 
the 3-byte field indicates that the Vendor OUI is unspecified. 

6.3.17  Vendor Part Number (00h 168-183) 
The vendor part number (vendor PN) is a 16-byte field that contains ASCII 
characters, left aligned and padded on the right with ASCII spaces (20h), defining 
the vendor part number or product name. A value of all zero in the 16-byte field 
indicates that the vendor PN is unspecified. 

6.3.18  Vendor Revision Number (00h 184-185) 
The vendor revision number (vendor rev) is a 2-byte field that contains ASCII 
characters, left aligned and padded on the right with ASCII spaces (20h), defining 
the vendor's product revision number. A value of all zero in the field indicates 
that the vendor Rev is unspecified. 

6.3.19  Wavelength or Copper Cable Attenuation (00h 186-187) 
For optical free side devices, this parameter identifies the nominal transmitter 
output wavelength at room temperature. This parameter is a        16-bit hex value with 
Byte 186 as high order byte and Byte 187 as low order byte. The laser wavelength is 
equal to the 16-bit integer value divided by 20 in nm (units of 0.05 nm). This 
resolution should be adequate to cover all relevant wavelengths yet provide enough 
resolution for all expected DWDM applications. For accurate representation of 
controlled wavelength applications, this value should represent the center of the 
guaranteed wavelength range.  
 
If the free side device is identified as copper cable these registers will be used 
to define the cable attenuation. An indication of 0 dB attenuation refers to the 
case where the attenuation is not known or is unavailable. 
 
Byte 186 (00-FFh) is the copper cable attenuation at 2.5 GHz in units of 1 dB. 
 
Byte 187 (00-FFh) is the copper cable attenuation at 5.0 GHz in units of 1 dB. 

6.3.20  Wavelength Tolerance or Copper Cable Attenuation (00h 188-189) 
The guaranteed +/- range of transmitter output wavelength under all normal 
operating conditions. For direct attach cable assemblies, the value is zero. This 
parameter is a 16-bit value with Byte 188 as high order byte and Byte 189 as low 
order byte. The laser wavelength is equal to the 16-bit integer value divided by 
200 in nm (units of 0.005 nm). Thus, the following two examples: 
 
Example 1: 
 
10GBASE-LR Wavelength Range = 1260 to 1355 nm 
Nominal Wavelength in Bytes 186-187 = 1307.5 nm. 
Represented as INT(1307.5 nm * 20) = 26150 = 6626h 
Management Interface for Cabled Environments                               Page 57 Published                                                       SFF-8636 Rev 2.9 
 
Wavelength Tolerance in Bytes 188-189 = 47.5 nm. 
Represented as INT(47.5 nm * 200) = 9500 = 251Ch 
 
Example 2: 
 
ITU-T Grid Wavelength = 1534.25 nm (195.4 THz) with 0.236 nm (30 GHz) Tolerance 
Nominal Wavelength in Bytes 186-187 = 1534.25 nm. 
Represented as INT(1534.25 nm * 20) = 30685 = 77DDh 
Wavelength Tolerance in Bytes 188-189 = 0.236 nm. 
Represented as INT(0.236 nm * 200) = 47 = 002Fh 
 
If the free side device is identified as copper cable these registers will be used 
to define the cable attenuation. An indication of 0 dB attenuation refers to the 
case where the attenuation is not known or is unavailable. 
 
Byte 188 (00-FFh) is the copper cable attenuation at 7.0 GHz in units of 1 dB. 
 
Byte 189 (00-FFh) is the copper cable attenuation at 12.9 GHz in units of 1 dB. 

6.3.21  Maximum Case Temperature (00h 190) 
This parameter allows specification of a maximum case temperature other than the 
standard 70C. Maximum case temperature is an 8-bit value in degrees C. A value of 
00h indicates 70C. 

6.3.22  CC_BASE (00h 191) 
The check code is a 1-byte code that can be used to verify that the first 63 bytes 
of serial information in the free side device is valid. The check code shall be the 
low order 8 bits of the sum of the contents of all the bytes from 128 to 190, 
inclusive. 

6.3.23  Extended Specification Compliance Codes (00h 192) 
The Extended Specification Compliance Codes in Byte 192 identify the electronic or 
optical interfaces which are not included in Table 6-18 Specification Compliance 
Codes. These values are maintained in the Transceiver Management section of SFF-
8024 

6.3.24  Options (00h 193-195) 
The bits in the option field shall specify the options implemented in the free side 
device. 
 
Variable transceiver Tx input EQ and Rx output emphasis have been added, defined as 
the EQ and Emphasis capability designed into the transceiver in support of TP1a and 
TP4, respectively as defined in IEE802.3 Clause 86. Transceiver support of 
programmable EQ and Emphasis is found in Byte 193 bits 1 to 3 and shown below in 
Table 6-23. The default host control mechanism is "Fixed Position Programmable", 
found in Page 03h, Bytes 234-237 and documented in Table 6-33, Table 6-35 and Table 
6-36. If a transceiver supports "Adaptive EQ", defined as transceiver automatic 
internal control of EQ position setting (without host intervention), it can be so 
identified in Byte 193 bit 3. Adaptive EQ algorithms and periodicity are 
implementation specific. Control of "Adaptive EQ" is done using Upper Page 03h Byte 
241 bits 3-0 (per channel controls). 
 
The magnitude of Tx input EQ and Rx output emphasis supported by the transceiver is 
identified in Page 03h Byte 224. This applies to either Fixed Position Programmable 
or Adaptive EQ modes. 
 
CDR status and control functions are identified in Byte 194 bits 4 to 7. If Loss of 
Lock indicators (flags) are implemented bits 4 and 5 are set high. If CDR On/Off 
control is implemented bits 6 and 7 are set high. For transceivers with CDR 

Management Interface for Cabled Environments                               Page 58 Published                                                       SFF-8636 Rev 2.9 
 
capability, setting the CDR to ON engages the internal retiming function. Setting 
the CDR to OFF enables an internal bypassing mode, which directs traffic around the 
internal CDR. The two most common reasons to turn a CDR off (i.e. internally bypass 
it) are to run at bit rates not supported by a particular CDR or to save the 
thermal power in applications where CDR jitter mitigation is not required.

Digital Diagnostic Monitors monitor received power, bias current, supply voltage 
and temperature. Additionally, alarm and warning thresholds must be written as 
specified in this document. Auxiliary monitoring fields are optional extensions to 
Digital Diagnostics. 
 
All digital monitoring values must be internally calibrated and reported i         n the 
units defined in 6.2.5. 
 
Bit 2 indicates whether a transmitted power measurement is supported. The 
indication is required, however support of transmitter power measurement is 
optional (see Table 6-8). If the bit is set, transmitted power measurement is 
supported, and the module will monitor the average optical power. If not, 
transmitted power measurement is not supported. 
 
Bit 3 indicates whether the received power measurement represents average input 
optical power or OMA. The indication is required, however support of received power 
measurement is optional (see Table 6-8). If the bit is set, average power is 
monitored. If not, received power measurement is not supported,         or OMA is 
monitored.

To enable bit rates in excess of 25.4 Gbps, an extended bit rate field has been 
added in Byte 222 to supplement the existing values in Byte 140. The legacy Byte 
140 contains bit rate at 100Mb/bit, which is limited to 25.4Gbps. The new          Byte 222 
contains bit rate at 250Mb/bit, enabling up to 63.5Gbps. A        value of zero means this 
field is unspecified.

thresholds are required. These factory-preset values allow the user to determine 
when a particular value is outside of normal limits as determined by the free side 
device manufacturer. It is assumed that these values will vary with different 
technologies and different implementations. These values are stored in read-only

Output amplitude and output emphasis are defined at the appropriate test points 
defined by the relevant standard.  There is an illustration of reference test 
points in SFF-8679. 
  
Because receiver emphasis settings can affect receiver output amplitude (and vice 
versa) Table 6-34 and Table 6-36 define the variable parameter at a nominal 
condition of the other. For instance, Table 6-34 defines output amplitude at a zero 
output emphasis setting and Table 6-36 defines output emphasis at a nominal output 
amplitude setting (implementation dependent). The maximum emphasis supported is

defined in section 6.6.2, Table 6-32 byte 224. If an implementation does not 
support all levels up to and including the maximum, the nearest value shall be 
used. 
 
Squelch and output control functionality is optional. If implemented, squelch and 
output disable is controlled for each channel using Page 03h Bytes 240-241.  
Writing a '1' in the Squelch Disable register (Page 03h Byte 240) disables the 
squelch for the associated channel. Writing a '1' in the Output Disable register 
(Page 03h Byte 241) squelches the output of the associated channel. When a '1' is 
written in both registers for a channel, the associated output is disabled. The 
registers read all '0's upon power-up. All other squelch functionality details are 
outside the scope of this document.

6.7   Upper Page 20h and Upper Page 21h (Optional) 
 
The Upper Page 20h and Upper Page 21h contain support for additional monitored 
parameters for modules that have PAM4 modulation and/or have optical transmission 
wavelengths on a DWDM grid. 
 

6.7.1  Overview 
Many additional parameters may be supported by a QSFP with advanced modulation 
techniques. To allow monitoring of these parameters two new pages in the SFF         -
8436/SFF-8636 memory space are utilized. Pages 20h and 21h are assigned to monitor 
these parameters. The basic monitoring techniques are the same as for other 
monitored parameters (i.e., they support current value, latched warning/alarm 
status, masks and thresholds).  To indicate to the host device whether pages 2         0h 
and 21h are supported, page 00h byte 195 bit 0 is used. A value of 1b indicates 
that page 20h and 21h are supported as described in this section. A value of 0b 
indicates that pages 20h and 21h are not supported by the module. 
 
For a PAM4 signal several additional parameters are very useful to determine the 
health of the module and the line environment. These include bit error ratio and 
frame error rate calculations, a signal-to-noise ratio measurement and a level 
transition measurement that characterize the PAM eye, and a residual dispersion 
measurement. 
 
For a module implementing a Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing optical 
interface, there is a significant benefit in providing access to additional 
diagnostic monitoring parameters specifically for a DWDM module. In DWDM the 
wavelength or frequency of the laser is an extremely important parameter and 
monitoring it allows the health of the laser to be known. When a direct measurement 
of the error in the frequency is not available, the laser temperature          deviation 
from target is often used as a proxy. In addition, DWDM modules typically use a 
thermo-electric cooler (TEC) to control the laser temperature. The current flowing 
through the TEC is a strong indicator of the health of the module. A warning or 
error indication in any of these parameters can be an early indication of pending 
module failure. 
 
Other modules may require additional parameters to be defined in the future. 
 
It is expected that not all possible features will be supported by all modules or 
on all channels. To address this situation, this specification allows the module to 
determine which parameters are being monitored. Some parameters may be module-level 
in scope, and some may be channel-specific. This information is conveyed by the 
module to the host in the 2-byte parameter configuration registers (page 20h bytes 
200-248). To indicate that one or more parameters are not supported the module will 
report 00h in both bytes of the configuration register for that parameter. 
 
Up to 24 different parameters can be monitored, each providing a real-time value as 
well as alarm and warning flags. 16 threshold value sets are provided, and each of 
the 24 parameters is associated by the module with one of the threshold value sets. 
The parameter configuration registers indicate which threshold set is to be used 
with each parameter. Note that this implies that multiple parameters may share the 
same threshold set (for example, if the same parameter is measured on multiple 
channels). 
 
To facilitate future functionality without major specification changes, the 
parameter configuration registers provide an enumerated value for the specific 
parameter to be monitored.  
 
In addition to parameter monitoring, this specification includes a read-only

logical mapping indication feature which associates electrical channels with 
optical channels when that mapping is defined.

6.7.2.3    Mask Registers for Monitored Parameters 
These 12 bytes cover the interrupt masks for the latched alarm and warning flags. 
Each parameter has 4 bits with the most-significant bit representing the alarm high 
error, followed by low alarm, high warning and low warning as with other alarm and 
warning parameters. When a particular bit is 0, then the corresponding flag 
generates an interrupt. If the bit is 1 then an interrupt is not generated. As with 
the alarm and warning flags, for each parameter the highest bit number represents 
alarm high followed by alarm low, warning high and warning low masks.

6.7.2.4    Real-Time Value of Monitored Parameters 
These 48 bytes contain the real-time value of the monitored parameters. They are to 
be interpreted as specified in the Parameter Configuration Registers. In addition, 
the module will compare these values to the corresponding thresholds indicated in 
the Parameter Configuration Registers to generate the appropriate alarms and/or 
warnings in the registers above. As with the rest of SFF-8636, these parameters are 
all stored with the most significant byte in the lower numbered address.

6.7.2.5    Parameter Configuration Registers 
These 48 bytes determine how the real-time value registers, alarms and warnings, 
masks and thresholds are to be interpreted by the host. For each of the 24 possible 
monitored parameters the monitoring point, parameter type and threshold location 
are provided by the module.  The parameter configuration is a 2-byte field which is 
described below.

6.7.2.6    Electrical/Optical Lane Mapping 
This read-only feature allows the host to retrieve the electrical to optical 
channel mapping. For a PAM4 encoding, the electrical channel can be either mapped 
to the MSB or the LSB of the optical channel. This parameter is read-only. Each 
electrical channel has a 4-bit register in register 183 or 184 to define this 
mapping:

Figure 6-3 is a view of the aggregate PAM4 data expressed as a histogram measured 
at a vertical slice in the center of the eye, showing the measurement method for 
SNR and level transition parameters.

The histogram x-axis is in bins and the y-axis is in number of bin hits. The number 
of bins and the hit count magnitude is vendor specific. The histogram is taken at 
the point in the time domain where data is converted from analog to digital. The 
PAM4 slicer determines the best points to split the data between values of 0, 1, 2 
or 3. The peak is the bin with the largest number of counts between any two valleys 
(or below valley 1/above valley 3 for the first and last peaks). The valley 
location is determined by the slicer, and is the bin number where data below is 
considered to be i and data above is considered to be i+1. 
 
      The calculations for the reported eye parameters are: 
       
      SNR = 10* log   (min{SNR  , SNR , SNR  }) where SNR  = (µ  - µ )/(    +   ),

6.7.4  Detailed Description of New Monitored Parameters for PAM4 
6.7.4.1    SNR 
This feature measures the electrical signal-to-noise ratio on the ingress optical 
channel, as defined in Figure 6-3. It is the minimum of the individual eye SNR 
values, where the SNRi for each of the three eyes is defined as the ratio of the 
difference of the mean voltage between neighboring levels divided by the sum of the 
standard deviations of the two neighboring levels. 
 
SNR is encoded as a 16-bit unsigned integer in units of 1/256 dB. For example a 
value of 1380h will be interpreted as an SNR of 19.5 dB. 

6.7.4.2    Residual ISI/Dispersion: 
Chromatic dispersion is monitored at TP3 and will report the same value as an 
external dispersion meter (e.g., an optical vector analyzer) would report. The 
units are 0.1 ps/nm. For the vendor specified wavelength and line width, the 
accuracy of the reported Residual ISI/Dispersion parameter shall be better than +/-
100 ps/nm over specified temperature and voltage. 
  

6.7.4.3    PAM Level Transition Parameter 
This feature measures the electrical level slicer noise, as defined in Figure 6-3. 
It is the minimum of the individual PAM level LTP values, where the LTP for each 
PAM level is defined as the average of the peak histogram intensity of neighboring 
PAM levels divided by the minimum histogram intensity between them. Both the SNR 
and LTP parameters measure signal-to-noise but the LTP parameter is more sensitive 
to a noise floor. 
 
PAM Level Transition Parameter is encoded as a 16-bit unsigned integer in units of 
1/256 dB. For example a value of 3080h will be interpreted as an LTP of 48.5 dB. It 
is possible that the minimum histogram intensity between PAM levels is actually 
zero in which case this parameter would be infinite. In this case the special value 
of FFFFh will be used. If the parameter measures a value of greater than 255.996 dB 
but is not infinite, then FFFEh will be used. 
6.7.4.4    Error Figures 
Frame error rate is reported in RS(544,514) FEC equivalent frames (see IEEE 802.3 
Clause 91.5). If the actual FEC is not RS(544,514) then the measured frame error 
rate is converted. So for example, if the FEC frame size is 10% larger than the 
RS(544,514) FEC frame, then the reported frame error rate will be 10% higher than 
the measured frame error rate. This is done so as to be able to compare frame error 
rates regardless of the FEC encoding employed. 
 
Two different error figures may be supported: 
        
   RS(544,514) Frame Error Rate (FER): This parameter measures the 
Management Interface for Cabled Environments                               Page 84 Published                                                       SFF-8636 Rev 2.9 
 
    uncorrected/errored RS(544,514) equivalent frames per second. 
   Pre-FEC Bit Error Ratio (BER): This is the total number of errored bits that 
    were corrected by the FEC during an interval divided by the total number of bits 
    received in the interval. Note that different FEC schemes will have different 
    maximum pre-FEC BER requirements for a specific corrected BER maximum target. 
 
Both the BER and the FER will be monitored using the following technique: 
  


                                                                                                  
                      FIGURE 6-4: ERROR RATE ACCUMULATION INTERVALS 
 
The module shall collect BER/FER data over a vendor-specific fine time slice, 
defined by the module (for example, 1 ms). The host may read the data at a slower 
rate. 
 
The module calculates a BER/FER at each fine interval (light borders). The Host may 
have performance monitoring intervals (dark borders). Figure 6-4 shows a series (in 
time) of fine intervals punctuated by counter reset events that demark the host 
monitoring interval. If supported by the module, the host can read various 
calculated values. The selection of the which value(s) is/are available depends on 
the parameter type identifier (see Table 6-45). 
 
Current: 
 
If supported, the module shall keep a recent reading for the host to read at any 
time. This is referred to as the “instantaneous” value. For this value, a parameter 
type (See Table 6-45) of 12 for BER or 15 for FER is used. 
 
Average:  
 
If supported by the module, the average value shall be determined by using the 
counters reset function to program the averaging time interval. The module shall 
report a continuously averaged reading over the entire averaging interval. For this 
value, a parameter type of 4 for BER or 5 for FER is used. This value provides a 
glimpse as to how the current monitoring interval is performing. The module shall 
reset the counters for this purpose upon a write of 1b to register 250, bit 7 on 
page 20h. 
 
Prior Period: 
 
This value is the total averaged in the last monitoring interval as defined by the 
two most recent counter reset events. This is provided to assure that an interval 
can be calculated regardless of how quickly the host is reading the data. 
 
If supported, the module shall allow the host to continue to read the BER/FER that 
was averaged between the last two counter reset events (i.e. between the two dark 
lines in Figure 6-4). For this value, a parameter type of 12 for BER and 16 for FER

is used. The module shall reset the counters for this purpose upon a write of 1b to 
register 250, bit 7 on page 20h. 
 
Latched Maximum/Maximum: 
 
This is the largest/smallest fine-interval calculation since the last time the host 
read the data. The host can then keep track of the maximum of these readings to 
report as an overall maximum/minimum within its performance monitoring interval. 
 
If supported, the module shall latch the lowest and highest (respectively) 
measurements it has calculated over any fine interval since the last time the host 
read each value. The module shall clear the corresponding latch when the host reads 
the value. These values are not cleared with the counters reset feature. For these 
values, a parameter type of 9 for BER minimum, 10 for BER maximum, 13 for FER 
minimum, and 15 for FER maximum is used. 
 
Note that the thresholds system is maintained for BER and FER, but the low 
thresholds should be 0, and the high threshold for FER should also be 0 unless 
other error correcting schemes are present. 
 
The error parameters will be interpreted as an unsigned 16-bit floating point 
number with 5 bits for base-10 exponent, offset by -24, and 11 bits for mantissa. 
Thus the format is: 
                                        𝑚 ∗  10𝑠+𝑜 
Where m ranges from 0 to 2047 (11 bits), s ranges from 0 to 31 (5 bits) and o is 
fixed at -24. The smallest non-zero number is m=1 and s=0 or 1*10^(-24). The 
largest number supported is m=2047 and s=31, or 2.047*10^10. Within the 2 bytes of 
the value (stored lowest byte first), m and s are encoded as follows:

6.7.5  Detailed Description of New Monitored Parameters for DWDM 
6.7.5.1    TC Current 
If supported, this parameter monitors the amount of current flowing to the TC of a 
cooled laser. 
 
It is a 16-bit signed 2s complement value in increments of 0.1 mA. Thus the total 
range is from -3.2768 A to +3.2767 A. 
 

6.7.5.2    Laser Frequency 
If supported, this parameter monitors the difference (in frequency units) between 
the target center frequency and the actual current center frequency. It is a 
similar measurement to the Laser Temperature except expressed as a frequency 
difference instead of a temperature difference, and vendors may support one or the 
other measurement, or both. 
 
It is a 16-bit signed 2s complement value in increments of 10 MHz. Thus the total 
range is from -327.68 GHz to 327.67 GHz.

6.7.5.3    Laser Temperature 
If supported, this parameter monitors the laser temperature difference between the 
target laser temperature for a cooled laser, and the actual current temperature. It 
is a similar measurement to the Frequency Error except expressed as a temperature 
difference instead of a frequency difference, and vendors may support one or the 
other measurement, or both. 
 
It is a 16-bit signed 2s complement value in increments of 1/256 °C. Thus the total 
range is from -128 °C to +128 °C.

A.         Annex A 
 
Editor’s Note:For consideration as replacement text for subsection 
6.2.7. Rate Select or as a stand-alone Annex.  This proposed text is 
intended to clarify the rate select behavior without changing what is 
already documented.  Please review carefully and provide comments on 
whether to keep this as a stand-alone Annex. 
 

A.1     Rate Select and Configuration for Multi-rate Modules 
The host system (fixed-side) can use the management interface to reconfigure 
modules (free-side) to operate at different data rates or to comply with different 
specifications.  One method of reconfiguration is for the host to write directly, 
one at a time, to the various controls provided by the module. Alternatively the 
module may offer optional rate select controls whereby the host writes to a single 
location and the module firmware makes all necessary adjustments to change 
operation from one rate to another. 
 
When rate select controls are provided, the module may automatically make changes 
to the Tx and Rx datapath components, including the ability to: 
 
      Enable/Disable (bypass) Tx and Rx CDRs 
      Enable/Disable/Adjust Tx input equalizers and set fixed or adaptive modes of 
       operation 
      Enable/Disable/Adjust Rx output emphasis and Rx output amplitude 
      Adjust the bandwidth and/or gain of internal components 
 
Various advertising bits state which optional features are implemented by a module.

A.1.1         Direct Control Configuration 
The host system can directly control the CDRs, Tx Input Equalizers, Rx Output 
Emphasis and Rx Output Amplitude if those options are implemented by the module.  
After checking the various advertising bits, the host can control these features 

Management Interface for Cabled Environments                               Page 88 Published                                                       SFF-8636 Rev 2.9 
 
using the control bits at: 
 
Page 00h, byte 98:                Tx and Rx CDR control bits 
Page 03h, bytes 234-235:          Tx Input Equalizer settings 
Page 03h, byte 241, bits 3-0: Tx Input Adaptive Equalizer enable bits 
Page 03h, bytes 236-237:          Rx Output Emphasis settings 
Page 03h, bytes 238-239:          Rx Output Amplitude settings 
 
Note that CDRs and Tx input equalizers are designed for operation at the maximum 
data rate specified for the module.  For module operation at low data rates, the 
host may need to disable Tx and Rx CDRs and set the Tx input equalizers for 0 dB of 
equalization. 
 
A.1.1.1    Rate Select 
If rate select is supported by a module, the host can control data rates using 
either the Tx & Rx rate select control bits (bytes 87-88) or using the Tx & Rx 
application select control bits (bytes 89-92 and 94-97).  There are several 
advertising bits that tell the host whether the module supports rate select,          and 
which types of rate select are available. 
 
Table A-1 summarizes the advertising bits related to Rate Select support.

                                                   Select Table supported. 
 
If the module supports rate select the host can change configuration by using the 
rate select or application select controls at: 
 
Page 00h, bytes 87-88:     Tx and Rx Rate Select control bits 
Or 
Page 00h, bytes 89-92:     Rx Application Select control bits 
Page 00h, bytes 94-97:     Tx Application Select control bits 
 
The module is responsible for making all necessary adjustments for opera         tion at the 
selected data rate and/or application code.  These adjustments may include changes 
to Tx and Rx bandwidths, changes in CDR operation, and adjustments to equalizer, 
emphasis and amplitude settings, without requiring the host to write those control 
bits. 
 

Management Interface for Cabled Environments                               Page 89 Published                                                       SFF-8636 Rev 2.9 
 
If the module makes adjustments to these settings there is no requirement for the 
module firmware to change the related control bits.  For example, if the module 
bypasses the Tx or Rx CDRs in order to operate at a reduced data rate, byte 98 may 
still be set to show the CDRs enabled. 
 

A.1.1.2    Extended Rate Selection 
If one of the extended rate select versions is supported, as listed in          Table A-2, 
then the host can use bytes 87-88 to optimize the Tx and Rx data paths for 
particular data rates.  Two bits are assigned to each receiver in Byte 87 
(Rxn_Rate_Select) and two bits for each transmitter in Byte 88 (Txn_Rate_Select) to 
specify up to four bit rates.

       1             1        Optimized for 26 Gbps bit rates and above 

A.1.1.3    Rate Selection Using Application Select Table 
If rate selection using Application Select Table is supported, as listed in Table 
A-1, then the host can use bytes 89-92 to select the application for the Rx path 
and bytes 94-97 to select the application for the Tx path. The host reads the 
entire Application Select Table at Page 01h to determine the capabilities of the 
module. The host controls each channel separately by writing the Control Mode and 
Table Select (TS) fields to Bytes 89-92 and Bytes 94-97. The format for these bytes 
is shown in Table A-3. 
 
         TABLE A-3  APPLICATION SELECT (PAGE 00H BYTES 89-92 AND BYTES 94-97)

                 Control Mode                  Table Select TS 
 
 
Control Mode defines the application control mode as listed in Table A-4. Table 
Select selects the free side device behavior from the AST among 63 possibilities 
(000000 to 111110). Note that (111111) is invalid.
