 September 15, 2014           100G PSM4 Specification 

1. Introduction 
The 100G PSM4 Specification provides a low cost solution to long reach data center optical 
interconnects. The growth in data center size along with the increased data rates of optical 
interconnects has created a need for low cost solutions  capable of at least 500m reach.  The 100G PSM4 
Specification is targeted to service that need on a parallel single mode infrastructure, as a critical need 
of next generation data centers.  

This specification defines a four lane (per direction) 100 Gb/s optical interface to single mode fiber 
(SMF) media.  As shown in Figure 1, the 100G PSM4 Transceiver Module (100G PSM4 Module) provides 
Transmit Optics and Receive Optics between the Host IC and the fiber optic media.  A particular form 
factor, e.g. QSFP28 or CFP4, is not defined and the 100G PSM4 Transceiver Module may be 
implemented in various form factors.   Since management and control interfaces are form factor 
dependent, definition of these interfaces are outside the scope of this specification. 

 


                                                                           

                        Figure 1: PSM4 system block diagram 

 

The 100G PSM4 Specification defines requirements for a point-to-point  100 Gb/s link over eight single 
mode fibers up to at least 500 m.  Four identical and independent lanes are used for each signal 
direction. Table 1 shows  the primary attributes of the 100G PSM4 Specification.

 September 15, 2014           100G PSM4 Specification 

PSM4 uses four identical lanes per direction.  The electrical connections from the module to the host 
can be done using standard specific designs. Examples would be CAUI-4 (four electrical lanes with a 
10dB host channel). See Fibre Channel FC-PI-6p for operation at 28Gbps over four electrical lanes with a 
15dB host channel.

3. 100G PSM4 functional specifications 
The 100G PSM4 Module provides  a bi-directional electrical interface with the Host and a bi-directional 
optical interface with the fiber media. It performs Transmit and Receive functions that convey data 
between the Host and the media. 

3.1 100G  PSM4 Transmit/Receive  block diagram 
A 100G PSM4 Transmit/Receive block diagram is shown in Figure 2. The electrical and optical interface 
compliance points are identified as TP1 for the electrical input signals, TP2 for the optical output signal, 
TP3 for the optical input signal and TP4 for the electrical output signal.  Reference test 
fixtures/compliance boards, are used to access the electrical signals for parametric measurements.  The 
electrical signals, compliance boards and measurements are beyond the scope of this specification and 
the reader is referred to the appropriate specification, e.g. OIF CEI-28G-VSR or 802.3 Annex 83E.  It is not 
required that the compliance points are exposed or measurable as defined, however, if not, a 
conforming implementation must behave as though the interfaces are compliant. The optical transmit 
signal is defined at the output end of a singlemode fiber patch cord (TP2), between 2 m and 5 m in 
length. Unless specified otherwise, all optical transmitter measurements and tests defined in section 5.1 
are made at TP2. The optical receive signal is defined at the output of the fiber optic cabling (TP3). 

PSM4 MSA Group                                                          Page 8 
 September 15, 2014           100G PSM4 Specification 

Unless specified otherwise, all optical receiver measurements and tests defined in section 5.2 are made 
at TP3. 

 


                                                                               
                 Figure 2: Block diagram for PSM4 transmit/receive path 

 
3.2 100G  PSM4 transmit function 
The 100G PSM4 Transmit function shall convert the four electrical signals received from the host into 
the same number of optical signals. The optical signals are delivered to a fiber media that contains four 
parallel light paths for transmit, according to the transmit optical requirements in this specification.  
Higher optical power level in each signal stream shall correspond to tx_bit = one 

3.3 100G  PSM4 transmit disable function  
 The TX_DISABLE function is a global parameter that disables the transmission  of optical signals on all 
output optical ports and puts all of the optical outputs in the ‘off’ state. The TX_DISABLE function is 
initiated via the management interface. The output of the transmitter when presented with the 
TX_DISABLE request shall meet the requirements of Table 2. This 100G PSM4 Specification imposes  no 
response time requirements on the transmit function when presented with the transmit disable request.

 September 15, 2014           100G PSM4 Specification 

3.4 100G  PSM4 transmit fault function 
 The 100G PSM4 TX_FAULT function shall report its state via the management interface. TX_FAULT shall 
be a global indicator of the state of the transmit output.  

3.5 100G  PSM4 receive function 
The 100G PSM Receive function shall convert the four optical signals received from the fiber media into 
the same number of electrical signals according to the receive optical requirements in this specification. 
The higher optical power level in each signal stream shall correspond to rx_bit = one. 

3.6 100G PSM4 receive  fault function 
The 100G PSM4 RX_FAULT function shall report its state via the management interface. RX_FAULT shall 
be a global indicator of the state of the receiver input. 

3.7 100G  PSM4 global signal detect function 
The 100G PSM4 signal detect function shall report the state of SIGNAL_DETECT via the Management 
interface.  SIGNAL_DETECT shall be a global indicator of the presence of optical signals on all lanes. The 
value of the SIGNAL_DETECT parameter shall be generated according to the conditions defined in Table 
2. The PMD receiver is not required to verify whether a compliant PSM4 signal is being received. This 
100G PSM4 Specification imposes  no response time requirements on the generation of the 
SIGNAL_DETECT parameter. 

 

Table 2: SIGNAL_DETECT and TX_DISABLE value definition 

Function             Receive conditions            Transmit conditions 
SIGNAL_DETECT Fail   For any lane: Average optical power  
                     at TP3 ≤ -30 dBm 
SIGNAL_DETECT OK     For each lane:                 
                     [(Optical power at TP3 ≥ -10.5 dBm  
TX_DISABLE ON                                      Average Optical power at TP2 < -30 
                                                   dBm 
TX_DISABLE OFF                                     For all lanes:  
                                                   Optical power at TP2 > minimum 
                                                   OMA 
 
 
As an unavoidable consequence of the requirements for the setting of the SIGNAL_DETECT parameter, 
implementations must provide adequate margin between the input optical power level at which the 
SIGNAL_DETECT parameter is set to OK, and the inherent noise level of the 100G PSM4 including the 
effects of crosstalk, power supply  noise, etc. 

Various implementations of the Signal Detect function are permitted by 100G PSM4 Specification, 
including implementations that generate the SIGNAL_DETECT parameter values in response to the 


PSM4 MSA Group                                                         Page 10 
 September 15, 2014           100G PSM4 Specification 

amplitude of the modulation of the optical signal and implementations that respond to the average 
optical power of the modulated optical signal. 

3.8 100G  PSM4 lane-by-lane  signal detect function 
Various implementations of the Signal Detect function are permitted by 100G PSM4 Specification. Each 
100G PSM4_signal_detect_i, where i represents the lane number in the range 0:3, shall be continuously 
set in response to the optical signal on its associated lane, according to the requirements of Table 2. 

4. Lane assignments 
100G PSM4 provides a fixed relationship between electrical input and optical output lanes and between 
optical input and electrical output.  The electrical input on electrical lane 0 will appear as an optical 
output on optical lane 0.  The positioning of transmit and receive lanes at the optical interface is 
specified in 10.1 

5. Optical interface requirements for 100G PSM4  
The required operating range for the PSM4 is defined in Table 3. A compliant 100G PSM4 operates on 
single mode fibers according to the specifications of Table 11. A 100G PSM4 which exceeds the 
operating range requirement while meeting all other optical specifications is considered compliant (e.g., 
operating at 2000 m meets the operating range requirement of 2 m to 500 m). The signaling rate for a 
lane of a  100G PSM4 shall be as defined in Table 4. The optical signal at the transmit and receive side of 
the MDI is specified in Tables 4 and 5. Test points are defined in Figure 2. 

The bit error ratio (BER) shall be less than 5 × 10-5.  Note for 100G Ethernet applications the error 
statistics must be sufficiently  random that the BER results in an Ethernet frame loss ratio (see IEEE 
802.3bj clause 1.4.209a) of less than 6.2 × 10–10 for 64-octet frames with minimum inter-packet gap 
when processed according to IEEE 802.3bj Clause 91. Note: The use of the IEEE 802.3bj Clause 91 RS-FEC 
will result in a corrected BER of less than 1x10-12.

6. Definitions of optical parameters and measurement methods 
All transmitter optical measurements shall be made through a short patch cable, between 2 m and 5 m 
in length, unless otherwise specified. 

6.1 Test patterns for optical parameters 
While compliance is to be achieved in normal operation, specific test patterns are defined for 
measurement consistency and to enable measurement of some parameters. Table 7 gives the test 
patterns to be used in each measurement, unless otherwise specified, and also lists references to the 
sections in which each parameter is defined. Any of the test patterns given for a particular test in Table 8 
may be used to perform that test. The test patterns used in this specification are shown in Table 7.

6.1.1 Multi-lane testing  considerations 
TDP is defined for each lane, at the BER specified in section 5 on that lane. Stressed receiver sensitivity 
and receiver jitter tolerance are defined for an interface at the BER specified in section 5. The interface 
BER is the average of the four BERs of the receive lanes when they are stressed. 
Measurements with Pattern 3 (PRBS31) allow lane-by-lane BER measurements. Measurements with 
Pattern 5 (scrambled idle) give the interface BER if all lanes are stressed at the same time. If each lane is 
stressed in turn, the BER is diluted by the three unstressed lanes, and the BER for that stressed lane 
alone must be found, e.g., by multiplying by four if the unstressed lanes have low BER. To allow TDP 
measurement with Pattern 5, unstressed lanes for the error detector may be created by setting the 

PSM4 MSA Group                                                         Page 17 
 September 15, 2014           100G PSM4 Specification 

power at the reference receivers well above their sensitivities, or by copying the contents of the 
transmit lanes not under BER test to the error detector by other means. For stressed receiver sensitivity 
and receiver jitter tolerance measurements, unstressed lanes may be created by setting the power at 
the receiver under test well above its sensitivity and/or not stressing those lanes with ISI and jitter, or by 
other means. Each receive lane is stressed in turn while all are operated. All aggressor lanes are 
operated as specified. To find the interface BER, the BERs of all the lanes when stressed are averaged. 
Where relevant, parameters are defined with all co-propagating and counter-propagating lanes 
operational so that crosstalk effects are included. Where not otherwise specified, the maximum 
amplitude (OMA or VMA) for a particular situation is used, and for counter-propagating lanes, the 
minimum transition time is used. Alternative test methods that generate equivalent results may be 
used. While the lanes in a particular direction may share a common clock, the Tx and Rx directions are 
not synchronous  to each other. If Pattern 3 is used for the lanes not under test using a common clock, 
there is at least 31 UI delay between the PRBS31 patterns on one lane and any other lane. 

6.2 Wavelength  
The wavelength of each optical lane shall be within the range given in Table 4 if measured per TIA/EIA-
455-127-A or IEC 61280-1-3. The lane under test is modulated using the test pattern defined in Table 8. 
 
6.3 Average  optical power 
The average optical power of each lane shall be within the limits given in Table 4 if measured using the 
methods given in IEC 61280-1-1. The average optical power is measured using the test pattern defined 
in Table 8, per the test setup in IEEE 802.3 clause 53 Figure 53-6. 
 
6.4 Optical Modulation Amplitude (OMA) 
OMA shall be as defined in IEEE 802.3 clause 52.9.5 for measurement with a square wave (8 ones, 8 
zeros) test pattern or IEEE 802.3 clause 68.6.2 (from the variable Measured OMA in IEEE 802.3 clause 
68.6.6.2) for measurement with a PRBS9 test pattern. 

6.5 Transmitter  and dispersion penalty (TDP)  
Transmitter and dispersion  penalty (TDP) shall be as defined in IEEE 802.3 clause 52.9.10 with the 
exception that each optical lane is tested individually. The measurement procedure for PSM4 is detailed 
in 6.5.1 to 6.5.4. The lanes not under test shall be operating with PRBS31 or valid 100GBASE-R bit 
streams. 

6.5.1 Reference transmitter  requirements  
The reference transmitter is a high-quality instrument-grade device, which can be implemented by a CW 
laser modulated by a high-performance modulator. The basic requirements are as follows: 
a) Rise/fall times of less than 12 ps at 20% to 80%.  
b) The output optical eye is symmetric and passes the transmitter optical waveform test of 5.7. 
c) In the center 20% region of the eye, the worst-case vertical eye closure penalty as defined in 
IEEE   802.3 clause 87.8.11.2 is less than 0.5 dB. d) Total Jitter less than 0.2 UI peak-to-peak. e) RIN of         
less than –140 dB/Hz.  
f) Transmitter reflectance less than –50 dB. 
 

6.5.2 Channel requirements  
The transmitter is tested using an optical channel that meets the requirements listed in Table 9. 

PSM4 MSA Group                                                         Page 18

a
 The dispersion is measured for the wavelength of the device under test (in nm). The coefficient assumes 500 m for PSM4.  
b
  There is no intent to stress the sensitivity of the BERT’s optical receiver. 
c
  The optical return loss is applied at TP2. 
 
A PSM4 transmitter is to be compliant with a total dispersion  at least as negative as the “minimum 
dispersion” and at least as positive as the “maximum dispersion”  columns specified in Table 9 for the 
wavelength of the device under test. This may be achieved with channels consisting of fibers with 
lengths chosen to meet the dispersion  requirements.  
 
To verify that the fiber has the correct amount of dispersion,  the measurement method defined in IEC 
60793-1-42 may be used. The measurement is made in the linear power regime of the fiber.  
 

The channel provides an optical return loss specified in Table 9. The state of polarization of the back 
reflection is adjusted to create the greatest RIN.  

The mean DGD of the channel is to be less than the value specified in Table 9. 

6.5.3 Reference receiver requirements  
The reference receiver is required to have the bandwidth given in section 6.9. The sensitivity of the 
reference receiver is limited by Gaussian noise. The receiver has minimal threshold offset, deadband, 
hysteresis, baseline wander, deterministic jitter, or other distortions. Decision sampling has minimal 
uncertainty and setup/hold times.  
 
The nominal sensitivity of the reference receiver, S, is measured in OMA using the setup shown in IEEE 
802.3 Figure 52-12 of clause  52.9.10.3 without the test fiber and with the transversal filter removed. The 
sensitivity S must be corrected for any significant reference transmitter impairments including any 
vertical eye closure. It is measured while sampling at the eye center or corrected for off-center 
sampling. It is calibrated at the wavelength of the transmitter under test. 

 
Center of the eye is defined as the time halfway between the left and right sampling points within the 
eye where the measured BER is greater than or equal to 1x10-3 
 
The clock recovery unit (CRU) used in the TDP measurement has a corner frequency of 10 MHz and a 
slope of 20 dB/decade. When using a clock recovery unit as a clock for BER measurements, passing of 
low-frequency jitter from the data to the clock removes this low-frequency jitter from the 
measurement.

 September 15, 2014           100G PSM4 Specification 

6.5.4 Test procedure  
The test procedure is as defined in IEEE 802.3 clause 52.9.10.4 with the exception that all lanes are 
operational in both directions (transmit and receive) and the BER as specified in section 5 has to be met 
by the lane under test on its own. 
 
6.6 Extinction ratio  
The extinction ratio of each lane shall be within the limits given in Table 4 if measured using the 
methods specified in IEC 61280-2-2. The extinction ratio is measured using the test pattern defined in 
Table 8.  
NOTE—Extinction ratio and OMA are defined with different test patterns (see Table 8) 
6.7 Transmitter  optical waveform  (transmit eye)  
The required optical transmitter pulse shape characteristics are specified in the form of a mask of the 
transmitter eye diagram as shown in Figure 6. The transmitter optical waveform of a port transmitting 
the test pattern specified in Table 7 shall meet specifications of Table 5 when using a receiver with the 
fourth-order Bessel-Thomson response having a transfer function given by Equation 4. See Section 6.1.1 
for multi-lane test considerations.

                  Equation 4: Bessel Thompson Filter transfer function 

  
Normalized times of 0 and 1 on the unit interval scale are determined by the eye crossing means 
measured at the average value of the eye pattern. A clock recovery unit (CRU) is used to trigger the 
oscilloscope  for mask measurements. It has a high-frequency corner bandwidth of 10 MHz and a slope 
of -20 dB/decade. The CRU tracks acceptable levels of low-frequency jitter and wander. The filter 
nominal reference frequency fr is 19.34 GHz and the filter tolerances are as specified for STM-64 in ITU-T 
G.691.  The Bessel-Thomson receiver is not intended to represent the noise filter used within a 
compliant optical receiver, but is intended to provide uniform measurement conditions  at the 
transmitter. Compensation may be made for variation of the reference receiver filter response from an 
ideal fourth-order Bessel-Thomson response.

required. If measured, the test signal should  have negligible impairments such as intersymbol 
interference (ISI), rise/fall times, jitter and RIN. Instead, the normative requirement for receivers is 
stressed receiver sensitivity. 

6.9 Stressed  receiver  sensitivity  
Stressed receiver sensitivity shall be within the limits given in Table 5 if measured using the method 
defined in IEEE 802.3-2012 clause 52.9.9 with the conformance test signal at TP3 and with the following 
exceptions: 
a) The reference test procedure for a single lane is defined in 52.9.9. Multi-lane considerations for PSM4 
modules are given in Section 6.1.1 
b) The sinusoidal  jitter is at a fixed 200 MHz frequency and between 0 and 0.05 UI peak-to-peak 
amplitude. 
c) The sinusoidal  amplitude interferer is replaced by a Gaussian noise generator. 
d) The reference receiver used to verify the conformance test signal is required to have the bandwidth 
given in 6.9. The fourth-order Bessel-Thomson filter is replaced by a low-pass filter followed by a limiter 
and a fourth-order Bessel-Thomson  filter. 
e) The Gaussian noise generator, the amplitude of the sinusoidal  jitter, and the Bessel-Thomson filter 
are adjusted so that the VECP, J2 Jitter and J4 Jitter specifications given in Table 5 are simultaneously 
met (the random noise effects such as RIN, random clock jitter do not need to be minimized).

 September 15, 2014           100G PSM4 Specification 

f) After making the adjustments in e) the resultant signal is required to pass the mask defined in Figure 5 
with a hit ratio of less than 5 × 10–5 using the stressed eye mask coordinates in Table 5.  
g) The pattern for the received compliance signal is specified in Table 8. 
h) The interface BER of the PMD receiver is the average of the BER of all receive lanes while stressed at 
the specified receive OMA. 
i) Where CAUI-4 is exposed, a PMD receiver is considered compliant if it meets the CAUI-4 module 
electrical output specifications at TP4. 

7. Safety, installation, environment, and labeling 
7.1 General safety  
All equipment subject to this clause shall conform to IEC 60950-1. 
7.2 Laser safety  
PSM4 optical transceivers shall conform to Hazard Level 1 laser requirements as defined in IEC 60825-1 
and IEC 60825-2, under any condition of operation. This includes single fault conditions whether coupled 
into a fiber or out of an open bore.  
 
Conformance to additional laser safety standards may be required for operation within specific 
geographic regions.  
 
Laser safety standards and regulations require that the manufacturer of a laser product provide 
information about the product’s laser, safety features, labeling, use, maintenance, and service. This 
documentation explicitly defines requirements and usage restrictions on the host system necessary to 
meet these safety certifications. 

8. Fiber optic cabling model  
The fiber optic cabling model is shown in Figure 7.

mode dispersion  meet the specifications. Insertion loss measurements of installed fiber cables are made 
in accordance with ANSI/TIA/EIA-526-7/method A-1. The fiber optic cabling model (channel) defined 
here is the same as a simplex fiber optic link segment. The term channel is used here for consistency 
with generic cabling standards. 

9.  Characteristics of the fiber optic cabling (channel) 
The PSM4 fiber optic cabling shall meet the specifications defined in Table 10. The fiber optic cabling 
consists of one or more sections of fiber optic cable and any intermediate connections required to 
connect sections together.

Differential Group Delay (DGD) is the time difference at reception between the fractions of a pulse that were transmitted in 
the two principal states of polarization of an optical signal. DGD_max is the maximum differential group delay that the system 
must tolerate. 
d An additional 40 ps of skew variation could be caused by wavelength changes, which are attributable to the transmitter not 
the channel. 
9.1 Optical fiber cable  
The fiber optic cable requirements are satisfied by cables containing IEC 60793-2-50 type B1.1 
(dispersion  un-shifted single-mode), type B1.3 (low water peak single-mode), or type B6_a (bend 
insensitive) fibers or the requirements in Table 11 where they differ.

9.2.1 Connection insertion  loss 
The maximum link distance is based on an allocation of 3 dB total connection and splice loss. For 
example, this allocation supports  six connections with an average insertion loss per connection of 0.5 
dB. Connections  with different loss characteristics may be used provided the requirements of Table 10 
are met. 

9.2.2 Maximum discrete reflectance 
The maximum discrete reflectance shall be less than –35 dB per ISO/IEC 11801. 

10.  Medium Dependent Interface (MDI) 
The 100G PSM4 module is coupled to the fiber optic cabling at the MDI. The MDI is the interface 
between the 100G PSM4 module and the “fiber optic cabling” (as shown in Figure 5). The PSM4 100G 
module is coupled to the fiber optic cabling through one connector plug into the MDI optical receptacle 
as shown in Figure 7. Example constructions of the MDI include the following:  
 
a) 100G PSM4 with a connectorized fiber pigtail plugged into an adapter; 
b) 100G PSM4 receptacle.

optical lanes of PSM4 shall occupy the positions  depicted in Figure 8 when looking into the MDI 
receptacle with the connector keyway feature on top. The interface contains eight active lanes within 
twelve total positions. The central 4 fibers may be physically present.

10.2 Medium Dependent Interface (MDI) requirements      
The MDI shall meet the dimensional  specifications of IEC 61754-7-1 interface 7-1-9: MPO device 
receptacle, angled interface. The plug terminating the optical fiber cabling shall meet the dimensional 
specifications of IEC 61754-7-1 interface 7-1-1: MPO female plug connector, down-angled interface for 2 
to 12 fibers. The MDI shall optically mate with the plug on the optical fiber cabling. Figure 9 shows an 
MPO female plug connector with down-angled interface, and an MDI as an active device receptacle with 
angled interface.
