Foreword  
 
The development work on this specification was done by the SFF Committee, an industry 
group. The membership of the committee since its formation in August 1990 has included a 
mix of companies which are leaders across the industry.  
 
When 2 1/2" diameter disk drives were introduced, there was no commonality on external 
dimensions e.g. physical size, mounting locations, connector type, and connector 
location, between vendors.  
 
The first use of these disk drives was in specific applications such as laptop portable 
computers and system integrators worked individually with vendors to develop the 
packaging. The result was wide diversity, and incompatibility. 
 
The problems faced by integrators, device suppliers, and component suppliers led to the 
formation of the SFF Committee as an industry ad hoc group to address the marketing and 
engineering considerations of the emerging new technology.  
 
During the development of the form factor definitions, other activities were suggested 
because participants in the SFF Committee faced more problems than the physical form 
factors of disk drives. In November 1992, the charter was expanded to address any issues 
of general interest and concern to the storage industry. The SFF Committee became a forum 
for resolving industry issues that are either not addressed by the standards process or 
need an immediate solution.  
 
    Those companies which have agreed to support a specification are identified in the 
    first pages of each SFF Specification. Industry consensus is not an essential 
    requirement to publish an SFF Specification because it is recognized that in an 
    emerging product area, there is room for more than one approach. By making the 
    documentation on competing proposals available, an integrator can examine the 
    alternatives available and select the product that is felt to be most suitable.  
 
SFF Committee meetings are held during T10 weeks (see www.t10.org), and Specific Subject 
Working Groups are held at the convenience of the participants. Material presented at SFF 
Committee meetings becomes public domain, and there are no restrictions on the open 
mailing of material presented at committee meetings.  
 
Most of the specifications developed by the SFF Committee have either been incorporated 
into standards or adopted as standards by EIA (Electronic Industries Association), ANSI 
(American National Standards Institute) and IEC (International Electro technical 
Commission).

The module contains a printed circuit board that mates with the electrical connector. The 
pads are designed for a sequenced mating: 
 
       First mate  - ground contacts 
       Second mate - power contacts 
       Third mate  - signal contacts 
 
For EMI protection the signals to the connector should be shut off when the module is 
removed. Standard board layout practices such as connections to Vcc and GND with Vias, 
use of short and equal-length differential signal lines, use of microstrip-lines and 50 
Ohm terminations are recommended. The chassis ground (case common) of the module should 
be isolated from the module's circuit ground, GND, to provide the equipment designer 
flexibility regarding connections between external electromagnetic interference shields 
and circuit ground, GND, of the module.

对于EMI保护，当模块拆卸时，应关闭连接器的信号。 建议使用标准电路板布局实践，例如使用Vias连接到Vcc和GND，使用短距离和等长差分信号线，使用微带线和50欧姆终端。 模块的机箱接地（外壳通用）应与模块的电路接地GND隔离，为设备设计人员提供模块外部电磁干扰屏蔽和电路接地GND之间连接的灵活性。

5.2  Low Speed Pin Descriptions 
In addition to the 2-wire serial interface the module has the following low speed pins 
for control and status: 
 
       ModSelL 
       ResetL 
       LPMode 
       ModPrsL 
       IntL 
5.2.1  ModSelL 
The ModSelL is an input pin. When held low by the host, the module responds to 2-wire 
serial communication commands. The ModSelL allows the use of multiple modules on a single 
2-wire interface bus. When the ModSelL is "High", the module shall not respond to or 
acknowledge any 2-wire interface communication from the host. ModSelL signal input node 
shall be biased to the "High" state in the module. 
 
In order to avoid conflicts, the host system shall not attempt 2-wire interface 
communications within the ModSelL de-assert time after any modules are deselected. 
Similarly, the host shall wait at least for the period of the ModSelL assert time before 
communicating with the newly selected module. The assertion and de-asserting periods of 
different modules may overlap as long as the above timing requirements are met. 
5.2.2  ResetL 
The ResetL pin shall be pulled to Vcc in the module. A low level on the ResetL pin for 
longer than the minimum pulse length (t_Reset_init) initiates a complete module reset, 
returning all user module settings to their default state. Module Reset Assert Time 
(t_init) starts on the rising edge after the low level on the ResetL pin is released. 
During the execution of a reset (t_init) the host shall disregard all status bits until 
the module indicates a completion of the reset interrupt. The module indicates this by 
asserting "low" an IntL signal with the Data_Not_Ready bit negated. Note that on power up 
(including hot insertion) the module should post this completion of reset interrupt 
without requiring a reset. 
5.2.3  LPMode 
The LPMode pin shall be pulled up to Vcc in the module. The pin is a hardware control 
used to put modules into a low power mode when high. By using the LPMode pin and a 
combination of the Power_override, Power_set and High_Power_Class_Enable software control 
bits (Address A0h, byte 93 bits 0,1,2), the host controls how much power a module can 
dissipate. 
 
See section 5.5 for more details on the power supply specifications.  
 
5.2.4  ModPrsL 
ModPrsL is pulled up to Vcc_Host on the host board and grounded in the module. The 
ModPrsL is asserted "Low" when inserted and deasserted "High" when the module is 
physically absent from the host connector. 
 
5.2.5  IntL 
IntL is an output pin. When IntL is "Low", it indicates a possible module operational 
fault or a status critical to the host system. The host identifies the source of the 
interrupt using the 2-wire serial interface. The IntL pin is an open collector output and 
shall be pulled to host supply voltage on the host board. The INTL pin is deasserted 
"High" after completion of reset, when byte 2 bit 0 (Data Not Ready) is read with a value 
of '0' and the flag field is read (see SFF-8636).

5.3  Low Speed Pin Electrical Specifications 
5.3.1  Low Speed Signaling 
Low speed signaling other than SCL and SDA is based on Low Voltage TTL (LVTTL) operating 
at Vcc. Vcc refers to the generic supply voltages of VccTx, VccRx, Vcc_host or Vcc1. 
Hosts shall use a pull-up resistor connected to Vcc_host on each of the 2-wire interface 
SCL (clock), SDA (data), and all low speed status outputs.  
 
The SCL and SDA is a hot plug interface that may support a bus topology. During module 
insertion or removal, the module may implement a pre-charge circuit which prevents 
corrupting data transfers from other modules that are already using the bus.  
 
Compliance with Table 5-3 provides compatibility between host bus masters and the 2-wire 
interface.

5.3.2  Low Speed Pin Timing    
Timing for SCL, SDA and ModSelL is defined in the common management interface document 
SFF-8636. Timing of the hardware control functions is specified in section 8. 
 
5.4  High Speed Pin Electrical Specifications 
5.4.1  Rx(n)(p/n) 
Rx(n)(p/n) are module receiver data outputs. Rx(n)(p/n) are AC-coupled 100 Ohm 
differential lines that should be terminated with 100 Ohm differentially at the Host 
ASIC(SerDes). The AC coupling is inside the module and not required on the Host board. 
For operation at 28 Gb/s the relevant standards (e.g., OIF CEI v3.1) define the signal 
requirements on the high-speed differential lines. For operation at lower rates, refer to 
the relevant standards.  
 
Note: Due to the possibility of insertion of legacy QSFP and QSFP+ modules into a host 
designed for higher speed operation, it is recommended that the damage threshold of the 
host input be at least 1600 mV peak to peak differential. 
 
Output squelch for loss of optical input signal, hereafter Rx Squelch, is required and 
shall function as follows. In the event of the optical signal on any channel becoming 
equal to or less than the level required to assert LOS, then the receiver data output for 
that channel shall be squelched or disabled. In the squelched or disabled state output 
impedance levels are maintained while the differential voltage swing shall be less than 
 
QSFP+ 4X Base Electrical Specification                                            Page 17   Published                                                              SFF-8679 Rev 1.7  
 
50 mVpp. 
 
In normal operation the default case has Rx Squelch active. Rx Squelch can be deactivated 
using Rx Squelch Disable through the 2-wire serial interface. Rx Squelch Disable is an 
optional function. For specific details refer to SFF-8636. 
5.4.2  Tx(n)(p/n) 
Tx(n)(p/n) are module transmitter data inputs. They are AC-coupled 100 Ohm differential 
lines with 100 Ohm differential terminations inside the module. The AC coupling is inside 
the module and not required on the Host board. For operation at 28 Gb/s the relevant 
standards (e.g., OIF CEI v3.1) define the signal requirements on the high-speed 
differential lines. For operation at lower rates, refer to the relevant standards.  
Due to the possibility of insertion of modules into a host designed for lower speed 
operation, the damage threshold of the module input shall be at least 1600 mV peak to 
peak differential. 
 
Output squelch, hereafter Tx Squelch, for loss of input signal, hereafter Tx LOS, is an 
optional function. Where implemented it shall function as follows. In the event of the 
differential, peak-to-peak electrical signal on any channel becomes less than 50 mVpp, 
then the transmitter optical output for that channel shall be squelched or disabled and 
the associated TxLOS flag set. 
 
Where squelched, the transmitter OMA shall be less than or equal to -26 dBm and when 
disabled the transmitter power shall be less than or equal to -30 dBm. For applications, 
e.g. Ethernet, where the transmitter off condition is defined in terms of average power, 
disabling the transmitter is recommended and for applications, e.g. InfiniBand, where the 
transmitter off condition is defined in terms of OMA, squelching the transmitter is 
recommended. 
 
In module operation, where Tx Squelch is implemented, the default case has Tx Squelch 
active. Tx Squelch can be deactivated using Tx Squelch Disable through the 2-wire serial 
interface. Tx Squelch Disable is an optional function. For specific details refer to SFF-
8636. 
5.5  Power Supply Pins 
The circuit card in a QSFP28 module has three designated power pins, labeled VccTx, VccRx 
and Vcc1. When the QSFP28 module is "hot plugged" into a connector with power already 
present, the three pins have power applied concurrently.  The module is responsible for 
limiting the inrush current surge during a hot plug event. The host power supply is 
responsible for supplying up to the maximum inrush current limits during a hot plug event 
without causing disturbance to other modules and components on the same power supply. 
 
5.5.1  Power Classes and Maximum Power Consumption 
QSFP28 modules are categorized into several power classes as listed in Table 5-3. Power 
Classes are advertised in upper page 00h of the management interface, byte 129 (81h).

The specification of the host power supply filtering network is beyond the scope of this 
specification, particularly because of the wide range of QSFP28 module power classes. An 
example current waveform into a host filter, labeled I1 in Figure 5-4, is plotted in 
Figure 5-5. Each power connection has a supply filter for the purpose of filtering out 
high frequency noise and ripple from host-to-module.  During a hot-plug event, the filter 
network limits any voltage drop on the host supply so that neighboring modules sharing 
the same supply stay within their specified supply voltage limits. 
 
A host board together with the QSFP28 module(s) forms an integrated power system. The 
host supplies stable power to the modules. Each module limits electrical noise coupled 
back into the host system and limits inrush charge/current during hot plug insertion. All 
specifications shall be met at the maximum power supply current. No power sequencing of 
the power supply is required of the host system since the module sequences the contacts 
in the order of ground, supply and signals during insertion. Any voltage drop across a 
filter network on the host is counted against the host DC set point accuracy 
specification.

5.5.2  Module Power Supply Specification 
In order to avoid exceeding the host system power capacity, upon hot-plug, power cycle or 
reset, all QSFP28 modules shall power up in power class 1, designated as "Low Power 
Mode".  QSFP28 modules that are class 1 will be fully functional after initialization and 
remain in low power mode during system operation. All other QSFP28 modules will only 
reach fully functional operation after the host system enables "High Power Mode".  
 
High power mode is defined as the maximum power class as advertised in page 00, byte 129 
and will only be enabled by the host if the host can supply sufficient power to the 
module. The host system controls whether a particular power class is enabled using the 
LPMode input pin and by writing to 3 control bits in byte 93. The management interface 
specification, SFF-8636 provides complete details but for explanation of power supply 
control, the bits are listed in Table 5‐4.

QSFP28 modules operate from the host supplied voltage at the three power pins. To protect 
the host and system operation, each QSFP28 module during hot plug and normal operation 
shall follow the requirements listed in Table 5-5 and illustrated in Figure 5-5.  
 
The test configuration for measuring the supply current is a module compliance board 
(MCB) with reference power supply filters, similar to the circuit shown in SFF-8431, 
Appendix D, and Figure 56. The QSFP28 MCB can have a single filter per module card or 
separate filters for each power pin on each module card, depending on the power class and 
module design. The current limits in Table 5-6 refer to the currents through each 
inductor. 
 
An example current waveform into a host filter, labeled I1 in Figure 5-4, is plotted in 
Figure 5-5. This figure also shows the timing of the initial module turn-on in low power 
mode, and the later transition to full power mode after the host system has enabled it 
via the two-wire interface.

discharge based on Human Body Model per JEDEC JESD22-A114-B. 
 

6  Mechanical and Board Definition 
6.1  Introduction 
The overall module defined in this clause is illustrated in Figure 6-1. All Pluggable 
modules and direct attach cable plugs must mate to the connector and cage design defined 
in this specification. The optical interface shall meet the dimensional specifications of 
IEC 61754-7 interface 7-3, the MPO adapter interface, and shall optically mate with the 
plug on the optical fiber cabling. Several cage-to-bezel options are possible. Both metal 
spring finger and elastomeric EMI solutions are permitted but must pass customer defined 
requirements. Heat sink/clip thermal designs are application specific and not defined by 
this specification; however a general design is given as an example.
