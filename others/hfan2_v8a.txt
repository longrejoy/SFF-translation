The double line effect may vary when the input data pattern is changed.  Possible Causes:  Pattern Dependent Jitter (PDJ) results from wide variations in the number of consecutive bits contained in NRZ data streams working against the available bandwidth. There are a number of conditions that can cause this effect.  The distortions in Figure 18 were caused by increasing the modulation current until the output transistor began to saturate, limiting its high-speed switching capabilities. The decreased switching speed limits the bandwidth during the rising edge.  The location of the lower -3dB cutoff frequency is Figure 20.  Pattern-Dependent Jitter Due to important, and must be set to pass the low frequencies High-Frequency Rolloff associated with long consecutive bit streams (Figure 19) in order to eliminate PDJ.                                            Potential Solutions:  (a) Increase the value of the AC PDJ can also be present due to insufficient high- coupling capacitor (CD in Figure 11).  (b) Increase the frequency bandwidth (Figure 20). If the amplifiers are value of the series damping resistor (RD in Figure 11). not fast enough to allow for complete transitions (c) Increase VCC.  (d) Decrease the modulation during single-bit patterns, or if the amplifier does not current. allow adequate settling time, high-frequency PDJ can result.

(This happens because each path may present unique charging/discharging characteristics.) PWD results when the midpoint crossing of a 0–1 transition and a 1–0 transition do not occur at the same level due to DC offsets (Figure 22). Unequal rising and falling edge speeds and DC offsets both contribute to asymmetrical eye diagrams.
